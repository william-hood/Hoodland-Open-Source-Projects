Change Scan is a tool for seeing what changed on a file system as the
result of a software install, uninstall, or any other process that
might cause files to be created, changed, or deleted. YOU MAY NEED TO
RUN THIS PROGRAM WITH ADMINISTRAIVE PRIVILEDGES.

1. Create a baseline...
   java -jar ChangeScan.jar ROOT <root folder> SAVE <baseline filename>

2. Install, Uninstall, or otherwise cause changes...

3. Scan again, comparing against the baseline...
   java -jar ChangeScan.jar ROOT <root folder> COMPARE <baseline filename> REPORT <report filename>

* Instead of ROOT and SAVE, the switch USE provides a comparison
  between two already existing baselines.
* Report is HTML format.
* Exclude items using EXCLUDE <DIRECTORY|FILE|PATTERN> <excluded item>
* Use verbose output with VERBOSE""")

As above, but exclude directory

As above, but exclude file

As above, but exclude everything with a substring
java -jar ChangeScan.jar ROOT <root> SAVE <filename> EXCLUDE PATTERN <substring>

As above, but with multiple exclusions (no limit)
java -jar ChangeScan.jar ROOT <root> SAVE <filename> EXCLUDE PATTERN <string> EXCLUDE FILE <filename> EXCLUDE DIRECTORY <name>

Scan and compare against the baseline (won't save this scan; you may add EXCLUDE as above)
java -jar ChangeScan.jar ROOT <root folder> COMPARE <baseline filename> REPORT <report filename>

DO NOT scan, just compare two baseline files
java -jar ChangeScan.jar USE <post change baseline>.fsc COMPARE <pre change baseline>.fsc

Note that 'EXCLUDE' is the only argument that may appear multiple times.
