// To create a typical Koarse Grind test, extend the Test class. Your extension class
// should only have the deafault constructor with no parameters, but pass the following
// into the constructor for the parent class...
//
// name:                A brief, human-readable name for the test.
//
// detailedDescription: This will appear as the first line of each test's log output.
//                      Make it detailed enough that someone unfamiliar with the test
//                      can figure out what it does.
//
// identifier:          If you use a test tracking system it typically provides each
//                      test with a test case ID. That's what this is for.
//
// categories:          Put some strings that each describe a category this test might
//                      fall into. "HappyPath", "SmokeTests", "HighPriority" are some
//                      suggested examples. It is possible to tell the test program
//                      to only run tests that match a certain category.
//
// ‚ÄºÔ∏è IMPORTANT ‚ÄºÔ∏è      Your test should only have the default constructor with no parameters.
//                      Otherwise it can not be automatically instantiated.
