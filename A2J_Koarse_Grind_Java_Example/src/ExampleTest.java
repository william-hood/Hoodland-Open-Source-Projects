//To create a typical Koarse Grind test, extend the Test class. Your extension class
//should only have the default constructor with no parameters, but pass the following
//into the constructor for the parent class...
//
//name:                A brief, human-readable name for the test.
//
//detailedDescription: This will appear as the first line of each test's log output.
//                   Make it detailed enough that someone unfamiliar with the test
//                   can figure out what it does.
//
//categoryPath:        Tests are organized in a hierarchy of categories. This will be
//                   reflected in both the log file and the hierarchy of test result
//                   folders. Specify the test's fully qualified path, with path
//                   names separated by pipe ("|") characters. The test will be at
//                   the top level if this parameter is left null.
//
//identifier:          If you use a test tracking system it typically provides each
//                   test with a test case ID. That's what this is for.
//
//‚ÄºÔ∏è IMPORTANT ‚ÄºÔ∏è      Your test should only have the default constructor with no parameters.
//                   Otherwise it can not be automatically instantiated.
